# MindKite launch and icon assets

- `LaunchBackground.imageset` provides the gradient canvas shown behind the native splash screen.
- `LaunchImage.imageset` supplies the glassmorphism tile and kite mark that fade into Flutter once rendering begins.
- `AppIcon.appiconset` PNGs were regenerated with the same gradient-and-kite treatment so the iOS app icon stays on brand across all device sizes.
